* to analyze of the poor result
* to analyze of the appearance of the words in each category using word cloud

<br>

## How to run the code
### 1. [The file](https://github.com/Haeun-Y/stress-detection/blob/main/stress-detection-word/word%20cloud.ipynb) was written in google colab.  
### 2. put the two files into train_file and test_file.

* [train_files](https://github.com/Haeun-Y/stress-detection/blob/main/dreaddit-train.csv)  <- train data file link  
* [test_files](https://github.com/Haeun-Y/stress-detection/blob/main/dreaddit-test.csv)  <- test data file link

### 3. And just run, you can see the picture as below.
