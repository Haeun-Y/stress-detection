# Analysis of model results

## Purpose of the code

- to classify the sentence to each category
- to test MultinomialNB and other models
- to use tf-idf instead of CountVectorizer
- to drop some categories

<br>

## How to run the code

### 1. All codes were written in google colab

- [MultinomialNB and other models](https://github.com/Haeun-Y/stress-detection/blob/main/stress-categorization/MultinomialNB%2C_RandomFroest%2C_SVM%2C_KNN_.ipynb)
- [Use tf-idf instead of CountVectorizer](https://github.com/Haeun-Y/stress-detection/blob/main/stress-categorization/tf_idf%2C_Logistic_Legression.ipynb)
- [Drop some categories](https://github.com/Haeun-Y/stress-detection/blob/main/stress-categorization/drop_categories.ipynb)

<br>

### 2. Put the two files into train_file and test_file

- [train_files](https://github.com/Haeun-Y/stress-detection/blob/main/dreaddit-train.csv) <- train data file link
- [test_files](https://github.com/Haeun-Y/stress-detection/blob/main/dreaddit-test.csv) <- test data file link

<br>

### 3. And just run the code, you can see the results

<br>

### 4. Put the stress sentence and check which type of stress it is
