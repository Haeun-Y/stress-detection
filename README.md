# stress-detection

## 1. Goal of the model
* detect stressed text with stress detection classifier
* categorize the stressed text with many types of stress

## 2. readme & code for stress detection 
* [stress detect with ~~]()

## 3. readme & code for stress types classifier
* [MultinomialNB and other models](https://github.com/Haeun-Y/stress-detection/blob/main/stress-categorization/MultinomialNB%2C_RandomFroest%2C_SVM%2C_KNN_.ipynb)
* [use tf-idf instead of CountVectorizer](https://github.com/Haeun-Y/stress-detection/blob/main/stress-categorization/tf_idf%2C_Logistic_Legression.ipynb)
* [drop some categories](https://github.com/Haeun-Y/stress-detection/blob/main/stress-categorization/drop_categories.ipynb)
* [analysis of the result](https://github.com/Haeun-Y/stress-detection/tree/main/stress-detection-word)
